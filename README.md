# Dave-s-Burger-Builder

Made some UI enhancements to the burger-builder react application that was built during Max Schwasmuller's React Tutorial on Udemy. The project features a combination of most react ecosystem core functionalities such as lifecycle methods and react-hooks, routing using react-router and react-router-dom libraries, state management using redux and redux-saga for asynchronous action calls, axios package for async data fecthing and jest/enzyme for elementary unit tests. I factored in some UI enhancements with the Material UI library and the sweetalert2 lib for alerts.
